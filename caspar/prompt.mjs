/**
 * Prompt composition: turning a Caspar task into what Claude Code is given.
 *
 * A task delivered by the Decillion backend carries far more than a question:
 *
 *   • `skill`      — the agent's deployed skill file (the proxy entity's
 *                    attachment). This IS the agent's identity and must override
 *                    any default persona, so it becomes an appended system
 *                    prompt, not part of the user turn.
 *   • `self` / `roster` / `groupChat` — a space is a shared group chat with
 *                    several agents and people; the agent has to know who it is,
 *                    who else is present, and the @mention protocol that decides
 *                    who gets triggered next.
 *   • `history`    — the thread's prior turns, each annotated with who it was
 *                    `from`, who it was directed `to`, and whether it was
 *                    `directedToMe`. Every agent sees every turn (it stays aware
 *                    of the whole team) but only replies to what is aimed at it.
 *   • `attachments`— files materialised into the workspace.
 *
 * The rendering mirrors the davinci agent's group-chat preamble and `[From → To]`
 * turn annotations, so an agent's behaviour in a Decillion space is unchanged
 * when this creature replaces davinci as the backbone.
