"""Deploy the per-space sandbox tool creature onto a running Caspar node.

Every Decillion space owns one cloud sandbox — the machine its agents work on —
and one docker creature owns them all: Nest signals it to create a sandbox when a
space is created and to destroy it when the space is deleted, and publishes it into
the space so every agent there discovers it as a tool. The binding is the sandbox's
*name*, derived from the space id, so no party has to store a mapping.

The creature (`caspar/tools/vercel_sandbox`) and the shared tool runtime
(`caspar/tools/_runtime`) live in this repository because this repository is the
platform's agent backbone: deploying agents and deploying the machine they work on
should not need two checkouts.

The Vercel credentials are read from this process's environment and **baked into
the creature image**, so they never travel in a signal payload an agent's prompt
could influence, and are never written to the repo.

Environment
-----------
    CASPAR_NODE_HOST / CASPAR_NODE_PORT / CASPAR_CA_BUNDLE

    Deploy operator (shared with the agent backbone + every other tool, so a
    redeploy owns the program it minted and never mints a fresh one — see
    caspar_deploy_common.resolve_operator):
      CASPAR_DEPLOY_IDENTITY_FILE   persisted operator identity (default: next to
                                    CASPAR_MANIFEST)
      CASPAR_OPERATOR_ID / CASPAR_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY   inject it explicitly
      CASPAR_DEPLOY_USER            first-login username only (default davinci_admin)

    SANDBOX_REUSE_PROGRAM_ID  redeploy onto this existing program id instead of
                              minting a new creature — what CI passes on every run
                              after the first, so the ids Nest recorded stay valid
    SANDBOX_TOOL_ENTITY_ID    entity id (default vercel_sandbox)
    SANDBOX_RUN_ENTITY        1 (default) to start it serving after the deploy
    SANDBOX_VM_RAM_MB / _DISK_GB / _CPUS / _MAX_SECONDS   VM resources
    SANDBOX_REBUILD_TIMEOUT   image build wait, seconds (default 480)

    VERCEL_TOKEN (or VERCEL_API_TOKEN / VERCEL_ACCESS_TOKEN), VERCEL_TEAM_ID,
    VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, VERCEL_API_BASE, VERCEL_SANDBOX_*  → baked into the image

Output (stdout, machine-readable — the CI greps these):
    SANDBOX_TOOL_PROGRAM_ID=<id>
    SANDBOX_TOOL_CREATURE_ID=<id>     (empty on a redeploy onto an existing program)
    SANDBOX_TOOL_ENTITY_ID=vercel_sandbox
    SANDBOX_TOOL_VM_ID=<vmId>         (when the standalone runEntity start succeeds)
